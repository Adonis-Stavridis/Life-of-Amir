# Life of Amir

----

An RPG Game built in **Unity** in collaboration with two friends, one them being Amir.

Most assets in this project are our own: scripts were written in **C#**, meshes modeled, animated and textured in Maya and Blender, and VFX created in Unity. Only sounds were found online.

Your objective is to pass 3 exams, then a find an object that will lead you to your final exam, where you will be tested of your skill and determine, for good, if you can master your computer.

But watch out! There are rumors the university has been infested by mutant computers and they can spawn out of nowhere! Also, people say the last exam is supposed to be about linked lists but nobody is really sure anymore. The challenge might be greater than expected.
